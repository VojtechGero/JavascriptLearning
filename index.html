            <p class="paragrapth">As a preparation for my Web appliactions course next semester I decided to learn some
                JavaScript. For
                tutorials I chose the same creator that thought me HTML and CSS, <span>Bro Code!</span>
                <br>
                For most of my life I have been using C-like languages. My first was C# and my second was C. Only for a
                short
                time did I actively use python, then came back to the good path with java and returned to C#.
                <br>
                But for web development JavaScript is enevitable, thus here we are...

                        Bro Code is one of the best, if not the best, tutorial content creators I know of on
                        YouTube.
                        <br>
                        Thanks to him, I learned HTML and CSS in just a month to complete a project for my basic web
                        development
                        course. The lecturer offered an option for those with prior experience to build a website in
                        the
                        first month of the semester. Although I had never written HTML before, I wanted to finish my
                        courses
                        as quickly as possible, so I decided to learn it fast.
                        <br>
                        Thanks to Bro Code's teaching, I went from having no knowledge at all to passing the course
                        in just a month.

                        Bro Code's teaching is great for understanding the basics of the languages he covers. The
                        only
                        issue
                        I had was that the tutorials seemed more geared towards people who have never programmed
                        before.
                        For
                        example, concepts like what a boolean is or the basics of objects weren't as relevant to me.
                        <br>
                        However, I found his explanations clear and his coding examples effectively demonstrated how
                        things
                        work.

                        The first project I did was a temperature convertor, converting between Fahrenheit and Celsius.
                        In the project I used the Math class to convert between the two units. Most of the code is in
                        the submit button event handler, aside from two functions for respective conversions. The cases
                        with not selecting conversion or not inputing a number are comunicated using alerts.

                        Another project I did was a dice rolling site. The dice were selected using string concatenation
                        when selecting the path to the image. The images are inserted into a div using innerHTML
                        artibute of a <i>&lt;div&gt;</i> element, which is not a ideal way to do that. But the project
                        was
                        focused on arrays first and formost. The result of each respective dice roll is stored in a
                        array and same goes to the created <i>&lt;img&gt;</i> elements as string that are in the end
                        inserted into
                        the innerHTML.
